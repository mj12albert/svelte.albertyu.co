I restored an older version (2014) of my portfolio using SvelteKit. The original site used Jekyll, Sass, and some spaghetti JavaScript (ES5) cobbled together with a spaghetti toolchain made with [gulp.js](https://gulpjs.com/)

### Quickstart

```bash
npm ci

npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

### Building

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
npm run build
```

Preview the production build:

```bash
npm run preview
```
